					<li>Software developer</li>
					<p>
						A computer programmer, sometimes called a software developer, a programmer or more recently a
						coder (especially in more informal contexts), is a person who creates computer software. The
						term computer programmer can refer to a specialist in one area of computers or to a generalist
						who writes computer programs. A programmer's most often-used computer language (e.g., Assembly,
						C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Lisp, Python, Java) may be prefixed to the term programmer. Some who
						work with web programming languages also prefix their titles with web.

					<li>Video game developer</li>
					<p>
						A video game developer is a software developer specializing in video game development – the
						process and related disciplines of creating video games.[1][2] A game developer can range from
						one person who undertakes all tasks[3] to a large business with employee responsibilities split
						between individual disciplines, such as programming, design, art, testing, etc. Most game
						development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support.[4]
						Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie
						games.[5] A developer may specialize in a certain video game console (such as Nintendo's
						Nintendo Switch, Microsoft's Xbox One, Sony's PlayStation 4), or may develop for a number of
						systems (including personal computers and mobile devices).[citation needed] Video game
						developers specialize in certain types of games (such as role-playing video games or
						first-person shooters). Some focus on porting games from one system to another, or translating
						games from one language to another. Less commonly, some do software development work in addition
						to games. Most video game publishers maintain development studios (such as Electronic Arts's EA
						Canada, Square Enix's studios, Activision's Radical Entertainment, Nintendo EAD and Sony's
						Polyphony Digital and Naughty Dog). However, since publishing is still their primary activity
						they are generally described as "publishers" rather than "developers". Developers may be private
						as well (such as how Bungie was, the company which developed the Halo series exclusive to
						Microsoft's Xbox).

					<li>Web developer</li>
					<p>
						A web developer is a programmer who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the
						development of World Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The applications
						typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or
						Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. A web developer may
						specialize in client-side applications (front-end developer), server-side applications (back-end
						developer), or both (full-stack developer). A web content management system may be used to
						develop and maintain web applications.
