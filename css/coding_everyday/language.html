						JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one
						of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites
						use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party
						libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on
						users' devices.

					<p>
						C (/ˈsiː/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language
						supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type
						system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.
						It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such
						applications include operating systems and various application software for computer
						architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.
